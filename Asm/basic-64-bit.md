Basic 64 Bit Project Workflow
--------------------------------

1. Download Flat Assembly 64 at http://flatassembler.net/download.php

2. Write template, save as source.asm or whatever you like

  ```bash

	format PE64 GUI 4.0
	entry Start

	include 'win64a.inc'

	section '.text' code readable executable

	  Start:
	  			;write any 32/64 bit code here
				push  rbp
				pop   rbp
				invoke  ExitProcess,0


	section '.data' data readable writeable

	copyleft db 'Hello 64',0

	section '.idata' import data readable writeable

	library kernel32,'KERNEL32.DLL'

	include 'api/kernel32.inc'
  ```

3. Create a batch file that automatically compiles your code

 ```bash

	@echo off
	SET INCLUDE=c:\tools\fasm64\include
	fasm.exe source.asm source.exe

 ```

4. Now, whenever you modify your code just run this batch to compile (assumes source code is named source.asm)
